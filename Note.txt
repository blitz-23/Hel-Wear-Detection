Implementation Details:
------------------------
1. We are using Object detection method here.
2. We used yolo dataset for detecting helmet object
3. The aim of project is giving security alert to bank manager if a person wears a helmet inside ATM machine room
4. The person may carry a helmet also.
5. But we defined our problem of identifying helmet if weared by a person
6. For this we considered finding skin inside the helment
7. We define a threshold value for skin (if he hold in hands we will not considered as the score value for skin is less) and we detect it
8 SMS alret sent to manager in identification time
